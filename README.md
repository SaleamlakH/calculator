# Calculator

This project is part of the Foundation course part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). even if making it more responsive is part of the project, i use `custom property`, `relative units`, and `css functions, calc()` to make it responsive and accessible based on `the screen size` and `the browser font-size`.

The inspiration for this design is the samsung calculator design.

## Features
- **Basic Math**: Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Decimal number**: support decimal number inputs
- **Delete and Clear**: 
- **Keyboard Support**:
    - `Number keys`: Input digits
    - `backspace` : Delete last digit
    - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` : Operators
    - `=`: Calculate result

## Note of the project
- **Transform elements**: transforming elements by translating or scaling reduces the clickable area.

- **event.preventDefault()**: when you use this method make sure it doesn't affect the browser shortcuts. Try not to prevent the user from using browser shortcuts.
